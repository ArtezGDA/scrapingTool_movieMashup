# InstantTrailer
Tool for creating your instant trailer.

# Synopsis
InstantTrailer is a tool that creates new trailers based on existing ones.
It cuts scraped clips into small parts and merges them back together.


To use this tool we provide you with an existing database of videoclips, from where you can decide which ones you want to use.
We used 4K Video Downloader to do this. 
You can download 4K Video Downloader yourself here:

# Installation
To achieve the Instant Trailer, the following steps need to happen:


--> choose scraped footage from YouTube

--> cut the footage into parts

--> merge the parts into a new trailer


Our tool provides the last two steps. The only thing you need to do is create your own set of trailers from the database that we provide.

# Motivation
As Graphic Designers we wanted to develop our own skills and learn how to build our own tools. This way we can create applications or tools that suit our own specific workflow, in contrary to what most existing applications do: they're designed for a huge audience and therefore are made for the average user. This average user doesn't necessarily have to be you. That's why it's very convenient for a designer to be able to make their own tools that optimize their own specific workflow. 
That's why we decided to make this MovieMashup tool. 

Experimenting with cutting video clips and combining them is something that has already been done by a lot of people, but we're looking for a way to make this a whole lot easier and more interesting. 
We were fascinated by the way movies and movietrailers are built up: they all seem to have the same buildup, consisting of about 8 parts. This tool can be seen as a way to ridicule the hollywood industry and at the same time create interesting video mashups.
