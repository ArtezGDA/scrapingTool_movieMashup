# MovieMashup
Tool for Movie Mashups

# Synopsis
MovieMashup is a tool created to create a new, randomized video out of existing footage. 
From an existing database of video footage it will merge the files together into a new video. 

(At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains what the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.))

# Code Example
(Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.)

# Motivation
As Graphic Designers we wanted to develop our own skills and learn how to build our own tools. This way we can create applications or tools that suit our own specific workflow, in contrary to what most existing applications do: they're designed for a huge audience and therefore are made for the average user. This average user doesn't necessarily have to be you. That's why it's very convenient for a designer to be able to make their own tools that optimize their own specific workflow. 
That's why we decided to make this MovieMashup tool. 

Experimenting with cutting video clips and combining them is something that has already been done by a lot of people, but we're looking for a way to make this a whole lot easier and more interesting. 
We were fascinated by the way movies and movietrailers are built up: they all seem to have the same buildup, consisting of about 8 parts. This tool can be seen as a way to ridicule the hollywood industry and at the same time create interesting video mashups.

(A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.)

# Installation
(Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.)

# API Reference
(Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.)

# Tests
(Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.)

# Contributors
(Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.)

# License
(A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
